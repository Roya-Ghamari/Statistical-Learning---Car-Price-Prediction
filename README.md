In this study, we will explore the dataset of Car Dekho. The dataset is about secondhand cars and various features of the Cars. Our goal is to identify the most important variables in determining the price of used cars, and to model data based on these variables in order to predict the selling price of used cars with different manufacturing date. We first start with analysis of the factors that influence price of used cars by exploring the dataset and all the components in order to discover correlations between data with a simple linear regression model and then we will use multiple and polynomial regressions as well as a lasso model to find a proper model to predict the price.
